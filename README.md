Overview:
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the player's score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area.

This project implements the Snake Game using Python and the Turtle graphics library.
